Project Description：
This is a word-guessing mini-game based on Python and Pygame, where players try to guess hidden animal words by inputting letters. The game features sound effects and displays the remaining number of attempts.

How to Play：
1️⃣The game randomly selects an animal word and displays underscores for each letter.
2️⃣Players guess by entering one letter at a time.
3️⃣Regardless of whether the guess is correct or not, the number of attempts decreases by one each time.
4️⃣When the remaining attempts are less than 3, a warning sound will play and the remaining attempts will be displayed.
5️⃣If the player successfully guesses the word, a victory sound will play and a congratulatory message will be shown.
6️⃣If the attempts run out without guessing the word, a losing sound will play and the correct word will be revealed.
