Project Description：
This is a word-guessing mini-game based on Python and Pygame, where players try to guess hidden animal words by inputting letters. The game features sound effects and displays the remaining number of attempts.

How to Play→
·The game randomly selects an animal word and displays underscores for each letter.
·Players guess by entering one letter at a time.
·Regardless of whether the guess is correct or not, the number of attempts decreases by one each time.
·When the remaining attempts are less than 3, a warning sound will play and the remaining attempts will be displayed.
·If the player successfully guesses the word, a victory sound will play and a congratulatory message will be shown.
·If the attempts run out without guessing the word, a losing sound will play and the correct word will be revealed.
